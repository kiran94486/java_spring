 Projj title - THYMELEAF-POWERED E-COMMERCE SITEUSING JAVA SPRING 
My project aims to create a robust and scalable e-commerce site using Thymeleaf, Java Spring, and H2. Our goal is to provide our users with a seamless shopping experience while maintaining high performance and security standards. Thymeleaf's dynamic templating, Java Spring's powerful framework, and H2's lightweight and efficient database management system were key factors in our technology stack choices.
